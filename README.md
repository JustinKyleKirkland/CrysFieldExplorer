# CrysFieldExplorer
CrisFieldExplorer is a fast-converging Python package for optimizing crystal field parameters.

The novalty of CrysFieldExplorer is it adopts a new loss function using theory of characteristic polynomials. By adopting this loss function it can globaly optimize the CEF hamiltonian with Neutron + any other experimental data and does not rely much on accurate starting values, which is usually estimated from point charge models.
